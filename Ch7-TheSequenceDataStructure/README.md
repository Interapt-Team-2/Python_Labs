User Stories - Lab 6/Ch 7 - Listception
	Sequence Data Structure

Story: As a user, I want to generate a collection of lists (matrix) so that I can hold randomly generated numbers.

Acceptance Criteria:
User should be prompted to enter a single number between 5 and 10, to generate that number of lists.
User should be prompted to enter a single number between 15 and 20, to generate that number of elements in each list.
The program should coerce the user’s input to integers.
The program should create a data structure - buncha_lists - containing random numbers based on the user’s input.
The program should sort each element within buncha_lists and print out the newly sorted data structure.


Story: As a user, I want to view a list of the common elements within the collection of lists so that I can compare their similarities. 

Acceptance Criteria:

1. The program should have a function that finds the common elements within the collection of lists.
2. The program should print a list of the common elements.
